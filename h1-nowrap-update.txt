H1 NO-WRAP UPDATE - ee-benefits.html
=====================================

Ensured H1 text stays on one line on desktop without breaking.

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. DESKTOP H1 STYLING:
   Added: white-space: nowrap;
   
   This ensures "Where individuals and companies grow together." 
   remains on a single line on desktop screens.

2. RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINT:
   Added media query at 992px (tablet and below):
   
   @media (max-width: 992px) {
     .section-title h1 {
       white-space: normal;
     }
   }
   
   This allows the text to wrap naturally on smaller screens
   to prevent horizontal scrolling.

BEHAVIOR:
---------

Desktop (>992px):  Text stays on one line [✓]
Tablet (≤992px):   Text wraps naturally if needed
Mobile (≤768px):   Text wraps and stacks with mobile styling

EXAMPLE:
--------
Desktop:
  "Where individuals and companies grow together." [────────]
  ↑ All on one line

Tablet/Mobile:
  "Where individuals and companies
   grow together."
  ↑ Wraps when needed

STATUS: ✓ Complete
The H1 will now stay on one line on desktop while remaining
responsive on smaller devices.
